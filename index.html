  <h1 class="headercenter">Why You Need Lead-Gen-Bot</h1>
  <br>
    <h2>What Is Lead-Gen-Bot?</h2>
    <p>Lead-Gen-Bot is a PRAW bot that scans select subreddits for specific keywords and phrases chosen by a user and then sends that user a link to any posts in their subreddits of choice that contain any of the keywords or phrases that they chose.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Would Lead-Gen-Bot Benefit Me?</h2>
    <p>Reddit is a goldmine of data. If you're reading this, it's because you are actively using this data as a means to generate leads for your business. By leveraging Lead-Gen-Bot, you can automate that lead generation process and use the time you save skimming through Reddit posts to address other aspects of your business, or enjoy more free time than you currently do in order to achieve a better work-life balance. In fact, Lead-Gen-Bot is the reason I found your account prior to messaging you. I told it the keywords and phrases I was interested in, you commented one or more of those keywords and/or phrases, and it sent me a message with the link to your comment -- all without any effort on my part.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Will Using Lead-Gen-Bot Cause My Reddit Account to Be Deleted?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely not. Reddit is fine with bots as long as they are not used for two things: spam or spreading harmful content -- neither of which Lead-Gen-Bot does.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Is My Sensitive Data at Risk When Using Lead-Gen-Bot?</h2>
    <p>No. Lead-Gen-Bot doesn't require any info from you or your Reddit account aside form your username (so Lead-Gen-Bot knows who to send links to), the subreddits that you want Lead-Gen-Bot to monitor, and the keywords and phrases that you want Lead-Gen-Bot to search for. All of this info will be obtained from you through an intake form.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Does the Intake Form You Mentioned Above Work?</h2>
    <p>I send you a link to a Google Form, you fill it out, and I use the info in that form to tell Lead-Gen-Bot what subreddits to scan and which keywords and phrases to look for.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Many Leads Should I Expect to Get from Lead-Gen-Bot?</h2>
    <p>The amount of leads you get will depend on a few things. First, if the subreddits you are having Lead-Gen-Bot monitor are bigger, they will probably produce more leads. Conversely, if the subreddits you are having Lead-Gen-Bot monitor are on the smaller side, you will probably end up with less leads. Lastly, the keywords and phrases that you choose for Lead-Gen-Bot to look for are going to heavily influence the amount of leads you get. Choosing more generic keywords and phrases will result in more leads than more specific keywords and phrases. More generic keywords and phrases will produce a larger amount of high quality leads, but at the expense of a higher number of low quality leads as well. More specific keywords and phrases will produce less leads, but they will be much higher quality on average with a much smaller amount of low quality leads. It's up to you to decide how wide of a net you would like to cast regarding the keywords and phrases you choose.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Long Will It Take To Start Recieving Leads From Lead-Gen-Bot?</h2>
    <p>Once I recieve your intake form your bot should be up and running within 24 hours. Leads should start coming in shortly after that. Please note that the amount of leads that come in will depend on the size of subreddits that you want Lead-Gen-Bot to monitor and what keywords and phrases you want Lead-Gen-Bot to look for.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Much Does Lead-Gen-Bot Cost?</h2>
    <p>Lead-Gen-Bot is $25/month on a month to month basis with no long term commitments. If you become a paying user and ever get to the point where you no longer want to use Lead-Gen-Bot, simply message me or cancel your recurring payment and that will be that.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>You’re Just a Stranger on the Internet. How Do I Know That I Won’t Get Scammed?</h2>
    <p>That is a valid concern that everyone should have when interacting with strangers online. In order to build trust with you and allow you to see if Lead-Gen-Bot is a good match for your needs as an agent, you can try it for free for 14 days before paying a single cent. Furthermore, all transactions are handled through Stripe which is one of (if not the most) secure payment systems in the world. If I try to do anything funny, simply request a refund through Stripe and they will take care of the rest.</p>
