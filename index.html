  <h1 class="headercenter">Why You Need Lead-Gen-Bot</h1>
  <br>
    <h2>What Is Lead-Gen-Bot, What Does It Do, and Why Do I Need It?</h2>
    <p>Lead-Gen-Bot is a PRAW bot that scans select subreddits for specific keywords and phrases chosen by a user and then sends that user a link to any posts in their subreddits of choice that contain any of the keywords or phrases that they chose.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Will Using Lead-Gen-Bot Cause My Reddit Account to Be Deleted?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely not. Reddit is fine with bots as long as they are not used for spam or spreading harmful content which Lead-Gen-Bot does not do.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Is My Sensitive Data at Risk When Using Lead-Gen-Bot?</h2>
    <p>No. Lead-Gen-Bot doesn't require any info from you or your Reddit account aside form your username (so Lead-Gen-Bot knows who to send links to) and the keywords and phrases that you want Lead-Gen-Bot to search for which I will get via an intake form.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Does the Intake Form You Mentioned Above Work?</h2>
    <p>I send you a link to a Google Form, you fill it out, and I use the info in that form to tell Lead-Gen-Bot what subreddits to scan and which keywords and phrases to look for.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Much Does Lead-Gen-Bot Cost?</h2>
    <p>Lead-Gen-Bot is $25/month on a month to month basis with no long term commitments. If you become a paying user and ever get to the point where you no longer want to use Lead-Gen-Bot, simply message me or cancel your recurring payment and that will be that.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>You’re Just a Stranger on the Internet. How Do I Know That I Won’t Get Scammed?</h2>
    <p>That is a valid concern that everyone should have when interacting with strangers online. In order to build trust with you and allow you see if Lead-Gen-Bot is a good match for your needs as an agent, you can try it for free for 30 days before paying a cent. Furthermore, all transactions are handled through Stripe which is one of (if not the most) secure payment systems in the world. If I try to do anything funny, simply request a refund through Stripe and they will take care of the rest.</p>
